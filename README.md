# Ansible roles for Batfish

Intentionet has created this Ansible role to allow users to embed pre-deployment validation into any Ansible playbook. This role is hosted on Ansible Galaxy as Intentionet.batfish. The role includes a set of Ansible modules that analyze configuration files for an entire (or subset of a) network, allowing users to extract configuration data and perform network-wide validation tests in a completely vendor agnostic manner.

## Overview of Modules

**batfish_session** - Setup the connection to the server running Batfish or Batfish Enterprise

**batfish_init** - Initialize a network snapshot

**batfish_get_facts** - Retrieve configuration facts for devices in the snapshot

**batfish_validate_facts** - Validate configuration facts for devices in the snapshot

**batfish_assert** - Validate network behavior

## Documentation
Ansible module documentation can be found at https://docs.ansible.com by searching for Batfish or Intentionet.

## Examples
This example playbook outlines how to use the `Batfish.base` role to extract the list of interfaces for all devices in the network

```yaml
<insert sample playbook>
```
