# Ansible roles for Batfish

Intentionet has created this Ansible role to allow users to embed pre-deployment validation into any Ansible playbook. This role is hosted on Ansible Galaxy as `batfish.base`. The role includes a set of Ansible modules that analyze configuration files for an entire (or subset of a) network, allowing users to extract configuration data and perform network-wide validation tests in a completely vendor agnostic manner.

## Overview of Modules

**[bf_session](docs/bf_session.rst)** - Setup the connection to the server running Batfish or Batfish Enterprise

**[bf_init_snapshot](docs/bf_init_snapshot.rst)** - Initialize a network snapshot

**[bf_extract_facts](docs/bf_extract_facts.rst)** - Retrieve configuration facts for devices in the snapshot

**[bf_validate_facts](docs/bf_validate_facts.rst)** - Validate configuration facts for devices in the snapshot

**[bf_assert](docs/bf_assert.rst)** - Validate network behavior


## Examples
This example playbook outlines how to use the `batfish.base` role to extract the list of interfaces for all devices in the network.

```yaml
---
- name: Extract network device facts using Batfish and Ansible
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  gather_facts: no
  roles:
    - batfish.base

  tasks:

  - name: Setup connection to Batfish service
    bf_session:
      host: localhost
      name: local_batfish
  
  - name: Initialize the example network
    bf_init_snapshot:
      network: example_network
      snapshot: example_snapshot
      snapshot_data: ../networks/example
      overwrite: true

  - name: Retrieve Batfish Facts
    bf_extract_facts:
      output_directory: data/bf_facts
    register: bf_facts
    
  - name: Display configuration for all interfaces on all nodes
    debug: msg=" {{item.value.Interfaces}} "
    with_dict: "{{bf_facts.result.nodes}}"
    loop_control:
      label: " {{item.key}}.Interfaces "
    when: bf_facts.failed|bool == false
```
